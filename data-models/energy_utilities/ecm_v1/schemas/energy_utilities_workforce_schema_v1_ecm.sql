Crew dispatches are created by OMS dispatchers, updated by field supervisors via mobile devices, and consumed by workforce analytics, FEMA reimbursement reporting, and reliability performance measurement systems.. Existence Justification: Crew dispatch to outage events is a canonical M:N operational relationship in utility outage management. A single major outage event (e.g., transmission line failure, storm damage) routinely requires multiple crews dispatched sequentially or simultaneously for damage assessment, isolation, repair, and restoration. Conversely, a single crew responds to multiple distinct outage events during a shift, storm period, or mutual aid deployment.

Each record links one employee to one capex_project with attributes that exist only in the context of this specific project assignment. Supports capital cost tracking, labor capitalization, FERC reporting of labor costs by project, and resource planning across the capital portfolio.. Existence Justification: In utility capital project operations, employees are routinely assigned to multiple capital projects simultaneously with different roles and time allocations (e.g., a senior engineer at 30% on substation upgrade, 40% on transmission line replacement, 30% on distribution automation). Conversely, capital projects require cross-functional teams with multiple employees across disciplines (project managers, engineers, technicians, planners, safety officers). The business actively manages these assignments with specific roles, allocation percentages, labor rates, and approval workflows for capital cost tracking and FERC reporting.';
