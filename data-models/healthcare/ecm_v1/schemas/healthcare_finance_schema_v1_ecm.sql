It captures how restricted and unrestricted funds are allocated across organizational entities (hospitals, clinics, facilities) for compliance tracking, donor restriction management, and regulatory reporting. Each record links one organizational provider to one fund with allocation percentages, effective dates, and compliance status that exist only in the context of this relationship.. Existence Justification: In healthcare fund accounting, organizational providers (hospitals, clinics, facilities) participate in multiple funds simultaneously (operating funds, restricted grants, endowments, capital funds), and each fund is typically allocated across multiple organizational entities within an integrated delivery network or health system. The allocation relationship is actively managed by finance teams with specific percentages, effective dates, compliance tracking, and reporting requirements that belong to neither the provider nor the fund alone.';
