) COMMENT 'This association product represents the inclusion of a specific claim in a compliance audit sample. It captures the selection rationale, review status, and findings for each claim-audit pair. Each record links one claim to one audit with attributes that exist only in the context of this audit review relationship.. Existence Justification: In healthcare compliance operations, audits routinely sample multiple claims for review (RAC audits typically review 30-50 claims per provider, Joint Commission surveys sample across multiple encounters). Individual claims can be included in multiple audits over time—an initial HIPAA audit, a follow-up verification audit, a separate OIG work plan audit, or a CMS validation survey. The business actively manages claim audit samples as operational records, tracking selection rationale, review status, findings, and corrective actions for each claim-audit pair.';
