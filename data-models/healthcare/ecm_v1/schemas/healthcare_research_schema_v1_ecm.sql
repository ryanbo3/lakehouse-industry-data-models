) COMMENT 'This association product represents the training certification relationship between investigational products and compliance training programs. It captures product-specific training requirements, competency verification, and certification status for staff handling investigational products in clinical trials. Each record links one investigational product to one training program with attributes tracking certification dates, competency verification, training version compliance, and recertification schedules specific to that product-training combination.. Existence Justification: In clinical trial operations, investigational products require multiple types of training (handling hazardous materials, administering complex dosage forms, storage/temperature monitoring, controlled substance protocols), and each training program applies to multiple investigational products with similar characteristics. The business actively manages product-specific training certifications as operational records, tracking which staff are certified to handle which products, with certification dates, competency verification, and recertification schedules that exist only in the context of each product-training combination.';
