Used by staffing coordinators, compliance officers, and workforce management systems to track multi-site staffing across SNFs, home health agencies, and outpatient rehab centers..

Multi-site post-acute organizations and staffing agencies operationally manage these assignments with specific roles, FTE allocations, effective dates, and credentialing status per location. This is a core workforce management process that humans actively create, update, and terminate.';
