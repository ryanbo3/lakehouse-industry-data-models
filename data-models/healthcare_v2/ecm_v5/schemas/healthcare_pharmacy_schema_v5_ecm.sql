Each record links one drug to one study with attributes that exist only in the context of this research relationship. Supports drug accountability, formulary planning, and protocol compliance workflows managed by research pharmacists.. Existence Justification: Clinical research studies routinely test multiple drugs simultaneously (combination therapy, dose-ranging arms, active comparators vs. investigational agents), and each drug participates in multiple studies across different phases, indications, and institutions. Research pharmacists actively manage study-drug assignments as operational entities with arm-specific dosing protocols, blinding requirements, randomization tracking, and protocol version linkage. The business refers to these as study drug assignments or investigational product allocations and manages them for drug accountability, formulary planning, and regulatory compliance.';

Clinical pharmacists and care managers actively create and maintain these protocols as part of RPM program design.. Existence Justification: In healthcare, RPM programs monitor patients on specific medications — one RPM program (e.g., cardiac monitoring) covers multiple drugs (anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers), and one drug (e.g., metformin) may be monitored across multiple RPM programs (diabetes management, renal function monitoring, weight management).

Existence Justification: Post-acute care plans prescribe multiple medications for patients transitioning from acute care (e.g., pain management, anticoagulants, antibiotics), and the same drug from the drug master appears across many different care plans. Each plan-medication pairing carries its own dosage instructions, start/end dates, clinical indication, and monitoring requirements — data that belongs to neither the drug nor the care plan alone.
