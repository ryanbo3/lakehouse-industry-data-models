Used by utilization review, care coordination, and payer coverage determination workflows.. Existence Justification: In healthcare, a single ICD-10 diagnosis code (e.g., S72.001A - hip fracture) qualifies a patient for MANY post-acute services (physical therapy, occupational therapy, home health nursing, wound care), and a single post-acute service (e.g., physical therapy) is indicated for MANY diagnosis codes (hip fracture, knee replacement, stroke, spinal injury). Medicare and payer coverage determination requires explicitly managing which diagnosis-service combinations are approved, with effective dates and coverage types. This is an actively managed operational relationship that payers, utilization review teams, and post-acute coordinators create, update, and retire.';
