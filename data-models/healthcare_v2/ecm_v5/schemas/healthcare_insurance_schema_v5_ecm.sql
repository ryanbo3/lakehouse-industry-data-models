Existence Justification: Health plans actively maintain coverage matrices defining which post-acute care services they cover, with plan-specific benefit terms (copay amounts, prior authorization requirements, benefit limit days, coverage status, effective/termination dates). A single health plan covers many post-acute services, and a single post-acute service (e.g., physical therapy) is covered by many different health plans, each with distinct benefit terms. This is an operationally managed relationship that payer contract administrators create, update, and terminate as part of benefit design.';
