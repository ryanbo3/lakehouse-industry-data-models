Each record links one CDM entry to one research study with attributes that define whether the service is billed as research versus standard-of-care, the negotiated reimbursement rate for that study, and the effective period for those billing rules.. Existence Justification: In healthcare research operations, a single billable service (CDM entry) such as an MRI scan or lab test is routinely used across multiple research studies, and each research study requires multiple billable services as defined in its protocol. The billing treatment of each service varies by study based on sponsor agreements, protocol design, and standard-of-care determinations. Healthcare billing operations must maintain study-specific coverage rules, reimbursement rates, and effective dates for each service-study combination to ensure compliant charge routing and accurate claims submission.';

Existence Justification: In integrated delivery networks (IDNs), CDM entries are configured with site-specific pricing, revenue codes, and activation status across multiple care sites due to varying payer contracts, state regulations, cost structures, and service capabilities. Revenue cycle teams actively manage these site-specific configurations as operational business records, adjusting prices and activation status based on local market conditions, contract negotiations, and service line changes.
