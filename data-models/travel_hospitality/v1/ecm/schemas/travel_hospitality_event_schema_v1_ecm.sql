Existence Justification: In MICE event operations, corporate event bookings routinely include multiple curated experience programs (welcome receptions, team building activities, spa packages, culinary experiences, SALT programs) to enhance attendee satisfaction and differentiate the event offering. Conversely, each experience program definition (e.g., Executive Wellness Journey or Team Building Challenge) is enrolled across many different event bookings throughout the year. Event coordinators actively manage these enrollments as operational entities, tracking participant counts, delivery schedules, fulfillment progress, and event-specific costs for each program within each event.';

Existence Justification: In MICE event operations, event planners negotiate spa treatment packages that include multiple specific treatments (massage, facial, body wrap) as part of the overall event value proposition.
