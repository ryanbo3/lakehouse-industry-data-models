Existence Justification: In travel hospitality operations, experience programs are curated packages that bundle multiple amenities and services, including fitness classes. A single experience program (e.g., Wellness Journey or VIP Welcome Package) includes multiple fitness class types (yoga, pilates, HIIT) to give guests variety and choice. Conversely, a popular fitness class like Morning Yoga can be included in multiple experience programs (Wellness Journey, SALT Recovery Program, Anniversary Package) with different terms for each program. Program managers actively configure and manage these inclusions, specifying how many sessions are included, booking rules, and guest selection flexibility for each program-class pairing.';
