It captures the specific role, contract terms, performance, and financial details for each vendor participating in a capital improvement project. Each record links one vendor to one CIP project with attributes that exist only in the context of this specific engagement, such as contract value, dates, performance ratings, and the vendors role (general contractor, design engineer, materials supplier, testing lab, specialty consultant).. Existence Justification: In water utility capital improvement programs, CIP projects engage multiple vendors simultaneously in different roles (general contractor, design engineer, materials suppliers, testing labs, specialty consultants), and each vendor typically works on multiple projects concurrently across the utilitys CIP portfolio. The utility actively manages these engagements as distinct business entities, tracking contract-specific data such as awarded value, performance ratings, role assignments, and contract dates for each vendor-project combination.';
