Each record links one DMA to one crew with coverage period, coverage type (routine vs emergency), response priority, and after-hours responsibility flag. Supports crew dispatch planning, emergency response routing, and labor allocation for water loss control programs.. Existence Justification: In water utility operations, DMAs require coverage by multiple crews for different functions (leak detection crews, valve crews, emergency response crews) and shift periods (day shift, night shift, on-call). Simultaneously, field service crews are assigned to cover multiple DMAs across their service territory, with different coverage types (routine maintenance vs emergency response) and priority levels. The business actively manages these coverage assignments with start/end dates, coverage types, response priorities, and after-hours responsibility flags.';

Existence Justification: Water utilities operate multi-year blanket procurement contracts for pipe materials that supply multiple pipe main installations across different construction projects and time periods. A single procurement contract (covering specific materials, diameters, and pressure classes) supplies materials for many pipe main installations, and a large capital improvement project installing multiple pipe mains may draw from multiple procurement contracts due to different material specifications, vendor sources, or contract periods.
