Each record links one customer_account to one sampling_plan with attributes that exist only in the context of this participation relationship. Critical for LCRR compliance, lead/copper monitoring, and voluntary sampling programs.. Existence Justification: In water utility operations, customer accounts participate in multiple sampling plans simultaneously (e.g., a residential customer may be enrolled in LCRR Tier 1 lead/copper monitoring, seasonal DBP monitoring, and voluntary PFAS testing), and each sampling plan involves many customer accounts across the service territory. The utility actively manages these enrollments as operational records, tracking consent, access arrangements, notification preferences, and participation status for each customer-plan combination.
