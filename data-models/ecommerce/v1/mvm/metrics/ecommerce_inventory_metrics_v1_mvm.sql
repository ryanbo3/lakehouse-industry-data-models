      comment: "Average estimated cost of a stockout per unit across rules. Used alongside holding cost to calibrate optimal safety stock levels — a key input to inventory optimisation models."
    - name: "avg_demand_variability_coefficient"
      expr: AVG(CAST(demand_variability_coefficient AS DOUBLE))
      comment: "Average demand variability coefficient across rules. Measures demand unpredictability — a high average indicates the portfolio requires larger safety buffers and more frequent policy reviews."
