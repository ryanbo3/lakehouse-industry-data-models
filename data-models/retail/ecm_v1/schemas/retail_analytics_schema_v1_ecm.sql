) COMMENT 'This association product represents the measurement contract between supply chain SLA definitions and enterprise KPI definitions. It captures the specific measurement parameters, thresholds, and penalty structures that apply when a particular KPI is used to evaluate a particular SLA. Each record links one SLA definition to one KPI definition with measurement-specific attributes that exist only in the context of this monitoring relationship.. Existence Justification: In retail supply chain operations, a single SLA (e.g., Supplier Fill Rate SLA) is measured by multiple KPIs (fill rate percentage, order completeness count, line item accuracy), and each enterprise KPI (e.g., On-Time Delivery %) is used to measure multiple SLAs across different suppliers, product categories, and distribution centers. The business actively manages SLA performance scorecards where each KPI-SLA pairing has its own measurement frequency, threshold, penalty rate, and effective dates.';
