It captures the promotional strategy of allocating page space, prominence, and sales targets to categories within each circular. Each record links one circular_ad to one category with attributes that exist only in the context of this specific feature placement, including page location, visual prominence, space allocation, and category-specific performance targets for that circular edition.. Existence Justification: In retail circular planning, a single circular advertisement features multiple merchandise categories across different pages (e.g., Grocery on page 2, Apparel on page 5, Electronics on page 8), and each category appears in multiple circulars throughout the year (weekly, seasonal, holiday editions). Circular planning teams actively manage this many-to-many relationship by allocating page space, setting feature prominence, assigning category-specific sales targets, and tracking performance for each category within each circular edition. This is an operational business process with relationship-specific data.';

Each segment receives multiple different coupons over time as part of ongoing promotional strategy. Retailers actively manage these distribution events, tracking which coupons went to which segments, through which channels, and measuring redemption performance by segment to optimize future targeting decisions.';
