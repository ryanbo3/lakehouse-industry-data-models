This is a core pricing management entity that pricing analysts actively create, modify, and retire as market conditions and competitive dynamics evolve.. Existence Justification: In retail pricing operations, price lists are deployed across multiple price zones simultaneously (one list can serve multiple geographic markets), and each zone uses multiple price lists with priority-based resolution rules (e.g., promotional list overrides base EDLP list).
