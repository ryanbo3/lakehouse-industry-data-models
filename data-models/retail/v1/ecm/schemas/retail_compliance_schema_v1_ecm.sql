Existence Justification: In retail distribution operations, compliance programs (FDA food safety, OSHA workplace safety, ISO quality, organic certification, PCI-DSS) apply to multiple distribution centers, and each DC must maintain certification under multiple programs simultaneously. The relationship is actively managed by compliance teams who track facility-specific certification status, audit schedules, scope variations (e.g., food safety only applies to food DCs or specific temperature zones), and incident history. This is not a simple reference—its an operational certification management process with facility-specific data.';
