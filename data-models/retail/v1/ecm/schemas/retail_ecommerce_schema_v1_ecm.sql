It captures how a single merchandising assortment plan is adapted and deployed across different digital storefronts with locale-specific SKU selections, timing, and depth targets. Each record links one assortment_plan to one storefront with attributes that exist only in the context of this channel-specific execution.. Existence Justification: In retail operations, a single merchandising assortment plan (e.g., Spring Apparel 2024) is executed differently across multiple digital storefronts based on locale, market maturity, currency, and channel strategy. Conversely, a single storefront carries multiple assortment plans simultaneously across different categories, seasons, and departments. The business actively manages these storefront-specific assortment configurations as operational records with localized SKU selections, launch timing, budget allocations, and publication workflows.';
