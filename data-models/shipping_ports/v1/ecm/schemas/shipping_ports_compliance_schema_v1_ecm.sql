Each record links one customs declaration to one screening record with screening-specific attributes including timestamp, outcome, method, inspector, and anomaly flags that exist only in the context of this declaration-screening relationship..

Simultaneously, a single screening event (e.g., a radiation scan of a consolidated container) can cover multiple customs declarations for different consignments within that container. This is a true operational many-to-many relationship where security personnel actively create, track, and manage declaration-screening records with specific outcomes, methods, timestamps, and inspector assignments for each declaration-screening combination.';
