Each record links one pilot to one vessel type with endorsement-specific attributes including dates, limits, training status, and regulatory compliance data that exist only in the context of this specific endorsement.. Existence Justification: In maritime pilotage operations, pilots hold multiple vessel type endorsements (container ships, tankers, LNG carriers, bulk carriers, etc.), and each vessel type can be piloted by multiple qualified pilots. Licensing authorities track endorsement-specific training, operational limits (LOA, DWT), simulator training completion, expiry dates, and restrictions for each pilot-vessel type combination. This is an actively managed regulatory compliance relationship where endorsements are issued, renewed, suspended, and tracked independently.';

Each record links one surveyor to one agreement with attributes that exist only in the context of this authorization relationship, including authorized survey types, rate overrides, validity periods, exclusivity arrangements, and performance tracking.. Existence Justification: In maritime port operations, commercial agreements (with shipping lines, stevedoring companies, marine service providers) frequently establish surveyor panels authorizing multiple surveyors to perform various survey types under agreement-specific terms. A single surveyor operates under multiple agreements with different clients, and each agreement authorizes multiple surveyors to ensure coverage, specialization, and redundancy. The authorization relationship itself carries business-critical data including authorized survey types, negotiated rates, validity periods, exclusivity arrangements, and performance tracking that belongs neither to the surveyor master record nor the agreement master record.';
