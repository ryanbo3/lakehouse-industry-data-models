This is actively managed by HR and operations teams during organisational design, recruitment, compliance audits, and workforce planning.. Existence Justification: Position competency requirements represent a genuine operational M:N relationship actively managed by HR and operations teams. A position requires multiple competencies (e.g., a Quay Crane Operator position requires ISPS clearance, crane operator licence, safety induction, and medical fitness), and a competency is required by multiple positions (e.g., ISPS security clearance is required by Port Security Officer, Berth Gang Supervisor, and Marine Pilot positions). This relationship is managed during organisational design, recruitment, compliance audits, training planning, and competency change management.';
