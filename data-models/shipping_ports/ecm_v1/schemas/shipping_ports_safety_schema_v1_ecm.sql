Each record links one permit to one vendor with attributes that exist only in the context of this specific authorization.. Existence Justification: In port operations, a single permit-to-work for high-risk activities (hot work, confined space entry, crane lifts) routinely involves multiple vendors performing different specialized roles simultaneously - for example, a berth maintenance permit may authorize a welding contractor, a fire watch service provider, and a scaffolding supplier, each with distinct work scopes, personnel counts, and safety briefing requirements. Conversely, a single vendor (e.g., a welding contractor) performs work under multiple permits across different locations, time periods, and activity types throughout the port facility. The port authority must track vendor-specific authorizations, competencies, safety briefing completion, and supervision levels for each vendor under each permit to maintain ISO 45001 compliance and contractor safety management.';

It captures participant-specific risk exposure levels, control responsibilities, consultation records, and mitigation commitments for multi-party operations such as vessel-shore interface activities, dangerous goods handling involving multiple stakeholders, and shared operational areas. Each record links one risk assessment to one port community participant with attributes that exist only in the context of this specific involvement relationship.. Existence Justification: In maritime port operations, risk assessments for shared operational areas and multi-party activities (vessel-shore interface, dangerous goods handling, bunkering operations) genuinely involve multiple port community participants simultaneously, each with distinct exposure levels and control responsibilities. A single risk assessment for a vessel bunkering operation may involve the shipping line, bunkering service provider, port operator, and potentially customs/inspection authorities, each requiring formal consultation, risk acceptance, and mitigation commitments under ISO 45001. Conversely, a single participant like a major shipping line is involved in dozens of different risk assessments across different operational areas, vessel types, and hazardous activities throughout the year.';
