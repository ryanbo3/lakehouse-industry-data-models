Existence Justification: In maritime port operations, intermodal services (rail/truck corridors) operate on a subscription-based commercial model where multiple participant accounts can subscribe to the same service, and each account typically subscribes to multiple services based on their shipping corridor needs. The subscription itself is a contractual relationship with negotiated terms including volume commitments, pricing, service tiers, and priority levels that vary by account-service combination.';
