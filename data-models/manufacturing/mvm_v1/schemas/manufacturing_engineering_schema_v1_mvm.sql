Existence Justification: In PLM and engineering change management, an ECO formally governs changes to multiple components simultaneously (e.g., a design change affecting a PLC module, its mounting bracket, and a connector), while a single component can be affected by many ECOs over its lifecycle (initial release, design iterations, material substitutions, regulatory updates). This is a first-class operational relationship — engineers actively create, manage, and close Affected Item records per ECO-component pair, each carrying disposition instructions, revision transitions, and effectivity data that belong to neither the ECO nor the component alone.';
