It captures how operational costs are distributed across shared physical infrastructure when multiple departments (news, sports, production, engineering) utilize the same studios, master control rooms, NOCs, and transmission sites. Each record links one cost center to one broadcast facility with allocation percentages, usage periods, and metrics that exist only in the context of this shared-resource relationship.. Existence Justification: In Media Broadcasting operations, broadcast facilities (studios, master control rooms, NOCs, transmission sites) are shared infrastructure used by multiple operational cost centers simultaneously. A single studio facility serves news, sports, and entertainment production departments, while a single cost center like Digital Platform Operations utilizes multiple facilities (studio, NOC, data center) across different locations. The business actively manages these allocation relationships to distribute facility overhead costs for accurate departmental P&L and EBITDA reporting.';
