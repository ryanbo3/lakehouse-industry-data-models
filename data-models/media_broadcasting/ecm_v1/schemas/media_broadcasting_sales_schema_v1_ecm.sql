Existence Justification: In media broadcasting sales operations, a single proposal is routinely distributed to multiple contacts within an advertiser organization and agency (e.g., media buyer, brand manager, legal counsel, CFO for approval), and each contact receives and responds to multiple proposals over time. The business actively manages proposal distribution as an operational process with engagement tracking (who opened it, when, what feedback they provided) to prioritize follow-ups and refine proposals.

Each record links one sales account to one broadcast facility with attributes that define the service type, capacity allocation, pricing, and contract lifecycle dates that exist only in the context of this commercial relationship.. Existence Justification: In media broadcasting operations, large sales accounts (networks, station groups, advertising agencies, content licensees) routinely contract for services across multiple broadcast facilities simultaneously—a major advertiser may need studio access at multiple production facilities, transmission services at regional sites, and uplink capacity at satellite centers. Conversely, each broadcast facility serves multiple sales accounts concurrently, with different service types, capacity allocations, and commercial terms per account.
