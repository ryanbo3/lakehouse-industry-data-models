Each record links one title to one partner with attributes that define the commercial and territorial terms of that specific title-partner distribution arrangement.. Existence Justification: In media broadcasting operations, a single content title (film, series episode, music track) is distributed to multiple partners through different package configurations (theatrical package, streaming package, international syndication package), and each distribution partner receives multiple titles in their content packages. The business actively manages these distribution packages with partner-specific pricing tiers, territory scopes, format rights, and inclusion/exclusion dates as part of content licensing and syndication operations.';

Existence Justification: In broadcast operations, a single episode is transmitted via multiple equipment instances across different times, channels, and geographic regions (multi-channel broadcast, regional transmitters, redundancy failover, rerun schedules). Conversely, each transmission equipment asset broadcasts thousands of different episodes over its operational lifetime. Broadcasters actively manage and track each transmission event as a distinct operational record for FCC as-run logs, regulatory compliance, technical performance monitoring, and audience measurement.';
