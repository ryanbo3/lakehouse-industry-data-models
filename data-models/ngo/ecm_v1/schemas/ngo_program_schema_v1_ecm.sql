It captures which systems are actively used to deliver, monitor, or report on specific program components, including the functional role of each system, access permissions, and usage lifecycle dates. Each record links one component to one system platform with attributes that exist only in the context of this operational usage relationship.. Existence Justification: In NGO operations, program components routinely use multiple specialized digital systems simultaneously (e.g., a health component uses DHIS2 for health data, KoboToolbox for field surveys, and Salesforce for beneficiary tracking). Conversely, enterprise systems like Salesforce or DHIS2 serve multiple components across different programs and sectors. The business actively manages these usage relationships, tracking which systems support which components, provisioning access for component teams, and managing activation/deactivation as components evolve.';
