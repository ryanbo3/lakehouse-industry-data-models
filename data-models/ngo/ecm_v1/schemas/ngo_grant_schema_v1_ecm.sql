This is the operational record used for grant compliance reporting, effort certification, cost allocation, and workforce planning.. Existence Justification: In NGO operations, positions are routinely split-funded across multiple grant awards simultaneously (e.g., one position charged 40% to Award A, 35% to Award B, 25% to Award C), and each grant award funds multiple positions across the organization. This is an operational necessity for grant compliance, effort certification, and cost allocation reporting required by donors under 2 CFR 200 and similar frameworks. The relationship is actively managed by grant managers and finance teams who track effort percentages, funding periods, and cost allocations for each award-position combination.';
