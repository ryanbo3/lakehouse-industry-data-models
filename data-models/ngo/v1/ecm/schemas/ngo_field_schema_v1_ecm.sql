It captures the operational assignment of volunteers to specific distribution events, including their role, shift timing, hours worked, beneficiaries served, and performance assessment. Each record links one distribution_event to one volunteer with attributes that exist only in the context of this specific participation instance.. Existence Justification: Distribution events in humanitarian operations require multiple volunteers working in different functional roles (registration, verification, commodity handling, crowd management, translation), and volunteers participate in multiple distribution events over time. The organization actively manages volunteer assignments to distribution events, tracking role-specific performance, hours worked, beneficiaries served, and attendance for each participation instance. This is an operational business process, not an analytical correlation.';
