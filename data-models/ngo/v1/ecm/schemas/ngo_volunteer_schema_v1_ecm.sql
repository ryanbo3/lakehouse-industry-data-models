It captures the enrollment, completion, and certification lifecycle for each volunteers participation in a safeguarding training program. Each record links one volunteer to one training_program with attributes that track compliance status, certification validity, and completion evidence.. Existence Justification: In nonprofit operations, volunteers complete multiple safeguarding training programs over their tenure (PSEA awareness, child protection, code of conduct, investigation procedures), and each training program is completed by hundreds or thousands of volunteers across the organization. The business actively manages training completion records as a compliance obligation, tracking enrollment dates, completion status, certificate numbers, expiry dates, and renewal requirements for each volunteer-training combination. This is a recognized operational entity called training completion or training record that safeguarding officers query, update, and monitor for compliance reporting.';
