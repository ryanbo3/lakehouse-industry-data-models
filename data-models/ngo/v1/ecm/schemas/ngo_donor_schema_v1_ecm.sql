Existence Justification: In nonprofit fundraising operations, appeals routinely target multiple donor segments simultaneously with segment-specific execution parameters (different ask amounts for major vs. annual donors, different creative variants for A/B testing, wave-based deployment schedules). Each appeal-segment combination generates its own performance metrics (pieces sent, response rate, revenue, ROI) that fundraisers actively analyze to optimize future targeting decisions. This is not a theoretical correlation but an operational business process where development teams create targeting plans, execute multi-segment campaigns, and measure segment-level results.';

It captures the complete lifecycle of constituent participation in donor cultivation and fundraising activities, from initial registration through post-event follow-up. Each record links one constituent to one fundraising event with transactional attributes including registration details, ticketing information, seating assignments, payment tracking, attendance confirmation, and stewardship workflow status. This is a core operational entity managed actively by development and events staff for capacity planning, revenue tracking, donor engagement measurement, and post-event cultivation workflows.. Existence Justification: In nonprofit fundraising operations, constituents register for and attend multiple fundraising events over their donor lifecycle (galas, golf tournaments, cultivation dinners), and each event hosts multiple constituent attendees. Event registration is an actively managed operational process with its own lifecycle: registration → payment → seating assignment → check-in → post-event follow-up. This is distinct from gift processing—not all attendees make gifts, and registration data (ticket type, table assignment, dietary restrictions, attendance confirmation) is managed separately from donation transactions.';
