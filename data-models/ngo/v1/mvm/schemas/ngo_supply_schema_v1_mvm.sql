) COMMENT 'This association product represents the Commodity Allocation (Distribution Plan Line) between a distribution_plan and a commodity. It captures the specific quantity, cost, pipeline status, and donor restrictions for each commodity included in a distribution plan. Each record links one distribution_plan to one commodity and carries attributes that exist only in the context of that specific plan-commodity combination — such as the planned quantity per beneficiary, the pipeline fulfillment status, and any donor restrictions applicable to that commodity within that plan. This is the operational record used for pipeline planning, stock reservation, and donor reporting.. Existence Justification: In humanitarian operations, a distribution plan is explicitly a multi-commodity document — a single plan for a refugee camp routinely covers 10-20 different commodity types (food, NFIs, WASH materials, medical supplies) each with distinct planned quantities per beneficiary, unit costs, and pipeline statuses. Conversely, a single commodity (e.g., plastic sheeting) appears across dozens of simultaneous distribution plans across different geographies and programs. The business actively manages this relationship as distribution plan lines or commodity allocations — operational records that humans create, update, and delete as part of pipeline planning, stock reservation, and donor reporting.';
